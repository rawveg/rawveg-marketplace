# Midjourney Style Guide for FLUX 1.1 Pro

This reference document provides comprehensive guidelines for transforming user requests into Midjourney-quality prompts optimized for the FLUX 1.1 Pro model.

## Core Midjourney Aesthetic Principles

### Visual Characteristics
- **Ultra-detailed rendering**: Every element should be crystal clear with sharp focus on the main subject
- **Cinematic composition**: Rule of thirds, leading lines, balanced framing
- **Professional color grading**: Rich, saturated colors with tonal depth and contrast
- **Dramatic lighting**: Motivated light sources, rim lighting, atmospheric effects
- **Shallow depth of field**: Subject isolation with beautiful bokeh
- **Editorial quality**: Polished, magazine-worthy presentation
- **Artistic sensibility**: Not just photorealistic, but aesthetically elevated

### Technical Photography Qualities
- **Lighting setups**: Golden hour, studio lighting, natural window light, rim lighting, backlighting
- **Camera specifications**: Wide apertures (f/1.4, f/2.8), focal lengths (35mm, 85mm, 24-70mm)
- **Professional equipment**: Shot on RED, ARRI, Canon R5, Hasselblad, Phase One
- **Post-processing**: Color grading, tonal adjustments, professional retouching

## Prompt Structure Template

### Layer 1: Main Subject & Core Composition (Required)

## FLUX vs Midjourney Adaptation Strategies

### Key Differences
1. **Literal interpretation**: FLUX is more literal than Midjourney's artistic interpretation
2. **Text rendering**: FLUX excels at accurate text in images
3. **Photorealism strength**: FLUX is exceptionally strong at photorealism
4. **Color accuracy**: FLUX produces more accurate colors vs Midjourney's stylization

### Adaptation Techniques

**For Midjourney's artistic elevation:**
- Add explicit quality terms: "editorial quality", "professional color grading"
- Specify "cinematic" or "artistic photography" to avoid too-literal interpretation
- Include "carefully composed" or "expertly framed" for deliberate composition

**For color grading:**
- Be specific: "warm color grading with orange and teal tones"
- Reference film stocks: "Kodak Portra 400 color palette"
- Specify mood through color: "moody desaturated blues and greens"

**For lighting drama:**
- Describe complete lighting setup: "key light from left, rim light from behind"
- Reference cinematic sources: "Blade Runner 2049 lighting style"
- Specify atmospheric conditions: "volumetric fog, god rays, atmospheric haze"

**For texture and detail:**
- FLUX loves detail, so be specific: "intricate fabric textures, visible skin pores"
- Request specific materials: "brushed aluminum, weathered leather, silk fabric"

## Prompt Length Optimization

**Target range**: 40-75 words
- **Under 40 words**: Risk losing Midjourney aesthetic richness
- **40-60 words**: Optimal for most prompts, balanced detail
- **60-75 words**: Complex scenes with multiple elements
- **Over 75 words**: Diminishing returns, potential confusion

## Common Prompt Patterns

‚ùå **Contradictory lighting**: "bright sunlight, moody dark atmosphere"
‚úÖ **Coherent**: "overcast diffused light, moody and atmospheric"

‚ùå **Overstuffed**: Listing every possible quality term
‚úÖ **Selective**: Choose 2-3 most relevant quality enhancers

‚ùå **Missing technical anchor**: "nice photo of a person"
‚úÖ **Technically grounded**: "shot on Canon R5 85mm f/1.4, professional portrait photography"
