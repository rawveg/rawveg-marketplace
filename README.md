## 💻 Installation

### Method 1: Install the Entire Marketplace (Recommended)

Add the SkillsForge marketplace to access all skills:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add rawveg/rawveg-marketplace
```

Once added, you can:
- Browse all available skills with `/plugin`
- Install specific skills: `/plugin install skill-name@rawveg-marketplace`
- Update skills automatically when new versions are released

### Method 2: Install Individual Skills

If you prefer to install specific skills without adding the marketplace:

```bash
# Install directly from GitHub
/plugin install https://github.com/rawveg/rawveg-marketplace/tree/main/skill-name
```

### Method 3: Local Development

For testing or development:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rawveg/rawveg-marketplace.git

# Add as local marketplace
/plugin marketplace add ./rawveg-marketplace

# Or install individual skills locally
/plugin install ./rawveg-marketplace/skill-name
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Automatic Team Setup

To ensure your entire team has access to SkillsForge, add this to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "rawveg-marketplace": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "rawveg/rawveg-marketplace"
      }
    }

    "figlet-text-converter@rawveg-marketplace": {},
    "word-count-checker@rawveg-marketplace": {},
    "forem-api@rawveg-marketplace": {}

When team members trust the repository folder, Claude Code will automatically:
1. Install the SkillsForge marketplace

3. Keep everything synchronized

```bash
# List all marketplaces
/plugin marketplace list
